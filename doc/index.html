                NPYZFILE

Make image(s) from npy/npz file. Use `--&#39; to mark the beginning of NPYZFILEs
if necessary.

positional arguments:
  NPYZFILE              the npy/npz file from which to render image(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

data type options:
  -T DTYPE, --dtype DTYPE
                        enforce an expected data type of the image data.
                        Default to uint8
  -f, --force           render image even if the underlying data is not
                        normalized

clipping options:
  clip the image data before checking normalization; default to no clipping.
  The lower/upper bound will be casted to the data type as specified by
  `--dtype&#39;

  -l VMIN, --vmin VMIN  the lower bound of clipping
  -u VMAX, --vmax VMAX  the upper bound of clipping

indexing options:
  -C CHANNELS, --channels CHANNELS
                        the channel order, should be a string comprised of
                        {`N&#39;, `C&#39;, `H&#39;, `W&#39;}. The length of the string must be
                        identical to the extracted sub-tensor from NPYZFILE.
                        `N&#39; denotes any number of images; `C&#39; denotes any
                        color channel; `H&#39; denotes the height and `W&#39; the
                        width. `H&#39; and `W&#39; must occur one and only once; `C&#39;
                        must not occur more than once; `N&#39; may occur any
                        times. For example, `NHWC&#39; means the extracted tensor
                        is of shape `(N,H,W,C)&#39;, and `NNHW&#39; means the
                        extracted tensor is of shape `(N1,N2,H,W)&#39;. Default to
                        `HWC&#39;
  -K KEY, --key KEY     the npz data key; for simplicity, only one key can be
                        specified each time. This option will be omitted if
                        NPYZFILE is an npy file, and will be mandatory if
                        NPYZFILE is an npz file containing more than one key
  -I SLICE_EXPR, --index SLICE_EXPR
                        the indexing expression if it&#39;s not intended to use
                        the entire data file as source of images. For example,
                        `:,1:,... Default to `:&#39;

rendering options:
  -A CMAP, --cmap CMAP  cmap to use if underlying images are grayscale.
                        Default to gray

output options:
  -o [TOFILE], --tofile [TOFILE]
                        write to TOFILE; if there are multiple images to
                        render, the behavior will be up to the presence of
                        option `--overwrite&#39;. If TOFILE is left empty, TOFILE
                        will be set to stdout, and only the first image will

  -d TODIR, --todir TODIR

  -P OUT_TEMPLATE, --out-template OUT_TEMPLATE
                        the `str.format` template string used to form the
                        output file. This option will be omitted if TOFILE has
                        been specified. The template string is expected to
                        contain at most L positional placeholders where L is
                        the number of `N&#39; in CHANNELS, where the ith
                        placeholder will be replaced by the integer index of
                        the ith axis specified by CHANNELS; it may also
                        contain one keyword placeholder named `key&#39;, if
                        NPYZFILE is an npz file, where the placeholder will be
                        replaced by KEY. Default to `img-{}_..._{}.png&#39; where
                        there are L positional placeholders if NPYZFILE is an
                        npy file, and to `img-{key}_{}_..._{}.png&#39; otherwise.
  -F OUTPUT_FORMAT, --output-format OUTPUT_FORMAT
                        the image format to write; if specified, this option
                        overwrites the output format implied by OUT_TEMPLATE
  --overwrite           if not specified, abort whenever an existing file

Zip and compress npy or npz file(s). If the input is FILENAME.npy, the default
output will be FILENAME.npz with FILENAME.npy as a zip file entry within
FILENAME.npz. If the input is FILENAME.npz, the default output will be written
in-place such that the content is compressed if not already compressed. If the
input consists of multiple npy files, e.g. F1.npy, F2.npy, the output filename
must be specified, e.g. as OUT.npz, which will contain F1.npy and F2.npy as
zip file entries.

positional arguments:
